        Once upon a time there were three bears, who lived together in a house of their own in a wood. One of them was a little, small wee bear; one was a middle-sized bear, and the other was a great, huge bear.
        <br>
        <br>
        One day, after they had made porridge for their breakfast, they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling. And while they were walking, a little girl came into the house. This little girl had golden curls that tumbled down her back to her waist, and everyone called her by Goldilocks.
        <br>
        <br>
        Goldilocks went inside. First she tasted the porridge of the great, huge bear, and that was far too hot for her. And then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear, and that was too cold for her. And then she went to the porridge of the little, small wee bear, and tasted that. And that was neither too hot nor too cold, but just right; and she liked it so well, that she ate it all up.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then Goldilocks went upstairs into the bed chamber and first she lay down upon the bed of the great, huge bear, and then she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear and finally she lay down upon the bed of the little, small wee bear, and that was just right. So she covered herself up comfortably, and lay there until she fell fast asleep.
        <br>
        <br>
        By this time, the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough, so they came home to breakfast.
        “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY PORRIDGE!” said the great huge bear, in his great huge voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Somebody has been at my porridge!” said the middle bear, in his middle voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then the little, small wee bear looked at his, and there was the spoon in the porridge pot, but the porridge was all gone.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Somebody has been at my porridge, and has eaten it all up!” said the little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then the three bears went upstairs into their bedroom.
        <br>
        <br>
        “SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!” said the great, huge bear, in his great, rough, gruff voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Somebody has been lying in my bed!” said the middle bear, in his middle voice.
        And when the little, small, wee bear came to look at his bed, upon the pillow there was a pool of golden curls, and the angelic face of a little girl snoring away, fast asleep.
        <br>
        <br>
        “Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!” Said the little, small wee bear, in his little, small wee voice.
        <br>
        <br>
        Goldilocks jumped off the bed and ran downstairs, out of the door and down the garden path. She ran and she ran until she reached the house of her grandmama. When she told her grandmama about the house of the three bears who lived in the wood, her granny said: “My my, what a wild imagination you have, child!”

        Little Red Riding Hood

    <div class="section">
        Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest.  Whenever she went out, the little girl wore a red riding cloak, so everyone in the village called her Little Red Riding Hood.
        <br>
        One morning, Little Red Riding Hood asked her mother if she could go to visit her grandmother as it had been awhile since they'd seen each other.
        <br>
        "That's a good idea," her mother said.  So they packed a nice basket for Little Red Riding Hood to take to her grandmother.
        <br>
        When the basket was ready, the little girl put on her red cloak and kissed her mother goodbye.
        <br>
        "Remember, go straight to Grandma's house," her mother cautioned.  "Don't dawdle along the way and please don't talk to strangers!  The woods are dangerous."
        <br>
        "Don't worry, mommy," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll be careful."
        <br>
        But when Little Red Riding Hood noticed some lovely flowers in the woods, she forgot her promise to her mother.  She picked a few, watched the butterflies flit about for awhile, listened to the frogs croaking and then picked a few more. 
        <br>
        Little Red Riding Hood was enjoying the warm summer day so much, that she didn't notice a dark shadow approaching out of the forest behind her...
        <br>
        Suddenly, the wolf appeared beside her.
        <br>
        "What are you doing out here, little girl?" the wolf asked in a voice as friendly as he could muster.
        <br>
        "I'm on my way to see my Grandma who lives through the forest, near the brook,"  Little Red Riding Hood replied.
        <br>
        Then she realized how late she was and quickly excused herself, rushing down the path to her Grandma's house. 
        <br>
        The wolf, in the meantime, took a shortcut...
        <br>
        The wolf, a little out of breath from running, arrived at Grandma's and knocked lightly at the door.
        <br>
        "Oh thank goodness dear!  Come in, come in!  I was worried sick that something had happened to you in the forest," said Grandma thinking that the knock was her granddaughter.
        <br>
        The wolf let himself in.  Poor Granny did not have time to say another word, before the wolf gobbled her up!
        <br>
        The wolf let out a satisfied burp, and then poked through Granny's wardrobe to find a nightgown that he liked.  He added a frilly sleeping cap, and for good measure, dabbed some of Granny's perfume behind his pointy ears.
        <br>
        A few minutes later, Red Riding Hood knocked on the door.  The wolf jumped into bed and pulled the covers over his nose.  "Who is it?" he called in a cackly voice.
        <br>
        "It's me, Little Red Riding Hood."
        <br>
        "Oh how lovely!  Do come in, my dear," croaked the wolf.
        <br>
        When Little Red Riding Hood entered the little cottage, she could scarcely recognize her Grandmother.
        <br>
        "Grandmother!  Your voice sounds so odd.  Is something the matter?" she asked.
        <br>
        "Oh, I just have touch of a cold," squeaked the wolf adding a cough at the end to prove the point.
        <br>
        "But Grandmother!  What big ears you have," said Little Red Riding Hood as she edged closer to the bed.
        <br>
        "The better to hear you with, my dear," replied the wolf.
        <br>
        "But Grandmother!  What big eyes you have," said Little Red Riding Hood.
        <br>
        "The better to see you with, my dear," replied the wolf.
        <br>
        "But Grandmother!  What big teeth you have," said Little Red Riding Hood her voice quivering slightly.
        <br>
        "The better to eat you with, my dear," roared the wolf and he leapt out of the bed and began to chase the little girl.
        <br>
        Almost too late, Little Red Riding Hood realized that the person in the bed was not her Grandmother, but a hungry wolf.
        <br>
        She ran across the room and through the door, shouting, "Help!  Wolf!" as loudly as she could.
        <br>
        A woodsman who was chopping logs nearby heard her cry and ran towards the cottage as fast as he could.
        <br>
        He grabbed the wolf and made him spit out the poor Grandmother who was a bit frazzled by the whole experience, but still in one piece."Oh Grandma, I was so scared!"  sobbed Little Red Riding Hood, "I'll never speak to strangers or dawdle in the forest again."
        <br>
        "There, there, child.  You've learned an important lesson.  Thank goodness you shouted loud enough for this kind woodsman to hear you!"
        <br>
        The woodsman knocked out the wolf and carried him deep into the forest where he wouldn't bother people any longer.
        <br>
        Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother had a nice lunch and a long chat.
